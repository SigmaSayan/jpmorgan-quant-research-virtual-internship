# JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Internship Projects

This repository contains four hands-on projects completed as part of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program hosted on Forage. These projects simulate real-world challenges in financial modeling, credit risk estimation, and data-driven research—demonstrating foundational quantitative techniques used in the financial industry.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. Natural Gas Price Forecasting  
📄 File: `natural_gas_price_estimates_for_the_upcoming_year.ipynb`  
🧠 Objective: Predict future natural gas prices using time series data.  
🔍 Methods & Tools:

- Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting
- Seasonal-trend decomposition
- Visualization of trend, weekly/yearly seasonality

📈 Outcome: Accurate monthly price predictions for the upcoming year with interpretable seasonal components.

### 2. Prototype Pricing Model
📄 File: `prototype_pricing_model.ipynb`  
🧠 Description: Designed a prototype pricing model for financial products based on simulated market scenarios and product parameters. Implemented statistical and rule-based logic to reflect realistic price generation.

---

### 3. Loss Estimation  
📄 File: Loss_estimation.ipynb  
🧠 Objective: Estimate credit losses using basic observed default indicators.

🔍 Key Highlights:

- Treated default status as binary: 1 if default occurred, 0 otherwise.
- Calculated Expected Loss (EL) as:  
  EL = Default Indicator × Loss Given Default (LGD) × Exposure at Default (EAD)
- Aggregated losses over sample records to derive total credit loss.
- Demonstrated how observed defaults drive expected loss in a simplified setting.

📈 Outcome: Implemented a foundational approach to credit loss tracking and exposure measurement using real-world logic.

### 4. Quantization of FICO Scores
📄 File: `Quantization_of_FICO_scores.ipynb`  
🧠 Description: Engineered a quantization pipeline for FICO credit scores to transform continuous scores into discrete bins for use in downstream credit risk modeling and policy rule-making.
